ConvexHull
==========

This problem provides solution to many problems , for example calculate shortest path from one point to another point but there are few roadblocks in b/w. So part of the shortest path would lie on the convex hull.


This ALgo works only when anchor point(i.e starting point) is not collinear with 2 or more than 2 points.
